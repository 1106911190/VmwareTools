#VmwareTools 
I find it's too difficult to insatll---------VmwareTools
So,I hope this will be useful in the future~

It is useful in Vmware 9.0.
MwareTools-9.6.0-1294478.tar.gz is used for Linux.(such as Ubuntu.CentOS.Kali,I hava spent lots of time on them to fix the screen)
Windows.iso is used for WIndows.(such as windows XP.windows 10.windows server 2003)
Linux.iso (I don't think it's useful,but who knows ?)
